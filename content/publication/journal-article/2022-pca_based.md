<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding the structure of precipitation and its separation into stratiform and convective components is still today one of the important and interesting challenges for the scientific community. Despite this interest and the advances made in this field, the classification of rainfall into convective and stratiform components is still today not trivial. This study applies a novel criterion based on a clustering approach to analyze a high temporal resolution precipitation dataset collected for the period 2002â€“2018 over the Sicily (Italy). Starting from the rainfall events obtained from this dataset, the developed methodology makes it possible to classify the rainfall events into four different classes, which can be related to the convective and stratiform components of the events on the basis of their hyetograph shapes and average intensities. The results show that the occurrence of stratiform events is always much higher than the convective ones, especially in the winter and spring seasons, while from the summer to the mid-autumn the rainfall depth due to convective events results to be higher than that due to the stratiform events. Moreover, the comparison with a more widely accepted separation methodology demonstrates the physical consistency of the proposed methodology.
