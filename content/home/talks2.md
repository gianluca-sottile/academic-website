1. **PON AIM**. *Modeling of the microRNA system.* The activity consists in the creation of models of the specific microRNA-target system for each tissue of interest, including in the models the expression profiles of the system elements. To achieve this goal, some data-sets complete with microRNA and target RNA expression will be selected from public databases (for example NIH-TCGA), useful for teaching and validating the network models developed. *Study and development of algorithms for the prediction of genes regulated by microRNAs with network analysis techniques.* Starting from the microRNA-target interaction network models created to identify the differences between two tissues of interest, by comparing, for example, the predicted microRNA-target interaction networks for a tumor tissue and for the corresponding healthy tissue from the same patient, it will be It is possible to obtain information on the role of microRNAs in the onset of cancer.

1. **CoViSTAT19**. The COVID-19 epidemic calls each of us to act to defend our future. At the forefront it is done in hospitals where health workers (and the sick) fight and in laboratories where, tirelessly, the virus and the disease are studied. There is also a fight in the factories, in the streets where we monitor the application of the rules for the prevention of contagion and we continue to ensure the transit of goods; we fight in the shops for basic necessities (including drugs) that guarantee our subsistence. There is a struggle in government institutions to ensure continuity in the organization of our society. Finally, one fights by staying in one's own homes and observing the prescriptions that have been issued for the safeguarding of the most precious collective good, health. We researchers too are called to make our knowledge and skills available to the community. For this reason we have decided to set up a website through which to make available our analyzes and reflections on the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic.
